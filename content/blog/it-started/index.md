# Been a better professional
#### or When I realized that I'm not so good as a professional.

This post has two titles because my mind is a caos.
I realized that I am not a good professional. I'm a developer and work making things on the web but... not really.

The last months (maybe years), I've been stayed in the same ground and not updated my knowledge for quite a while.
It doesn't appear to me that I have made any kind of development in my carreer or learning experiences.
Now I feel some kind of urge to make a realy good project that helps me to get to the next level of knowledge and start to feel confidence in my work again.

The idea I had was to make a blog to write about my experiences and perhaps get involved in something new and exciting
This blog has to be about what I think about my process, what I heve learned and what I have to learn.

What will be my steps through this new learning path?

To have an online blog, that are some questions that needed to be answered:
- How do I make a blog?
- How to deploy it in cloud?
- What are the steps of CI/CD that needs to be done?


First, I will use Gatsby (node.js) as my starter pack at the front-end side.
For Cloud I need to learn more about AWS deployment steps and for CI/CD I will look for Github Actions information.
