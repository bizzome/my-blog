# Been a better professional
#### When I realized that I'm not as awesome as I thought.

This post has two titles because my mind is in chaos.
I realized that I am not a good professional. I'm a developer and work making things on the web but... not really.

For the past few months (maybe years), I've been stuck in the same place and haven't updated my knowledge for quite a while.
It doesn't seem like I have made any progress in my career or learning experiences.
Now I feel an urge to create a really good project that helps me reach the next level of knowledge and regain confidence in my work.

The idea I had was to create a blog to write about my experiences and perhaps get involved in something new and exciting.
This blog should be about my thoughts on the process, what I have learned, and what I still need to learn.

What will be my steps through this new learning path?

To have an online blog, there are some questions that need to be answered:
- How do I make a blog?
- How to deploy it in cloud?
- What are the steps of CI/CD that needs to be done?


First, I will use Gatsby (Node.js) as my starter pack on the front-end side.
For the cloud, I need to learn more about AWS deployment steps, and for CI/CD, I will look for information on GitHub Actions.


## Update 1:
With this blog project, I learned how to use S3 to store webpage files and deploy it, training my skills on github actions to make the whole automated deployment process. Maybe these points could be shared in other posts on this blog.
